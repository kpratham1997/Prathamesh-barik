# About Me

Hello ! I'm an embedded systems engineer with over two years of experience, specializing in crafting robust, easily understandable, and easily maintainable firmware for embedded devices. Working remotely has been my recent norm, and I absolutely adore it! ðŸŒŸ

# My Work Experience Timeline Summary

* Jan 2024 - Now. @Ark infosolutions:- Debugged a few earlier projects till now and working on understanding embedded software in-depth.
* Feb 2023 - Dec 2023. @Circuit digest:- Dived deep into embedded software and implemented multiple projects while doing my job.
* Jun 2021 - Jan 2023. @Robu.in:- Implemented multiple projects (30+) based on Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266 and Rpi. Found that I want to do embedded software whole-heartedly.
